# 🌍 GIS Projects Repository

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my GIS Projects Repository. This collection includes custom tools and applied spatial analysis projects developed using **ArcGIS Pro**, **ArcPy**, and open geospatial data. The goal is to showcase both technical scripting (Python) and applied GIS analysis in solving real-world problems.

### 2️⃣ Mississauga Transit Accessibility Project
This applied GIS project uses spatial analysis techniques to assess **public transit accessibility in Mississauga**. The study identifies underserved areas by analyzing walkability buffers around bus stops, population density, and median income levels.

📍 **Key Methods**:
- Buffer Analysis (500m from MiWay stops)
- Kernel Density Analysis
- Census & Open Data Integration
